## Hi there üëã!




### About Me

My name is **Marcel**.
<br><br>
I'm mainly a **Java Developer**, who is currently trying to learn **Rust**. I deploy most of the stuff that I create or use using **Docker**.

Besides backends, I also work on frontends in the past mostly with the framework **Angular** but in the recent time I also used some **NuxtJS**.
